# OSAC Feature Dimensions

This file defines the cross-cutting dimensions that every OSAC PRD and design
document must address. Both the PRD (`/prd`) and design (`/design`) workflows
should consult this file during their ingest phases to ensure comprehensive
coverage.

## Services

Every feature applies to one or more OSAC services. The PRD must declare
which services are in scope, and the design must address service-specific
implementation differences.

| Service | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **BMaaS** | Bare Metal as a Service — provisioning and lifecycle of physical machines |
| **CaaS** | Cluster as a Service — Kubernetes cluster provisioning via Hosted Control Planes |
| **VMaaS** | Virtual Machines as a Service — KubeVirt-based compute instances |
| **MaaS** | Model as a Service — AI model serving and inference platform |
| **Enclave** | Day 1/Day 2 operations, installation monitoring, wizard UI |

## Personas

OSAC has four canonical personas (defined in `docs/personas.md`). Features
must specify what each affected persona can see and do. Use these exact names
in user stories and workflow descriptions.

| Persona | Role | Examples |
|---------|------|----------|
| **Cloud Provider Admin** | Works for the cloud provider. Handles tenant onboarding, sets quotas, manages global catalogs, is a super-user who can see all tenants. | Tenant onboarding, quota management, global template catalogs, resource allocation |
| **Cloud Infrastructure Admin** | Works for the cloud provider. Manages core infrastructure (network, firewall, compute, storage). Integrates control plane with local infrastructure. | Specify inventory backends, network classes, IP pools, storage tiers, DNS, integrate with Netris/VAST/ESI |
| **Tenant Admin** | Works for the tenant organization. Manages their org's config, users, IDP, quotas, and org-specific catalogs. Can only see their own organization. | Create networking objects, manage tenant resources, onboard users, control template visibility |
| **Tenant User** | Works for the tenant organization. Self-service provisions cloud resources, manages full lifecycle. Prefers click-ops but wants API/CLI for automation. | Order machines/clusters/VMs via catalog, manage instance lifecycle, view quota utilization |

## Cross-Cutting Dimensions

For each dimension below, the PRD should state what's in scope vs. explicitly
out of scope. The PRD should focus on "what" and "why" — detailed
implementation approaches belong in the design document.

### Tenant Onboarding

How does the feature interact with tenant provisioning?

- RBAC requirements (new roles, permissions, policy changes)
- IDP integration (authentication flows, identity provider considerations)
- Auto-provisioned resources during tenant creation
- Tenant isolation implications

### Inventory

Which inventory backend(s) does the feature use or affect?

- Does the feature add new inventory backends or extend existing ones?
- Which services consume the inventory data?

### Provisioning

What provisioning mechanism does the feature use?

- Which provisioning backend(s) are involved?
- Lifecycle stages affected (create, start, stop, restart, delete)
- Power management considerations (BMaaS)
- Cluster vs. ComputeInstance vs. bare metal provisioning differences

### Networking

Which networking backend(s) are involved?

- Is the integration through the OSAC networking API or a side-channel?
- Does the feature add or modify networking API resources?
- NetworkClass configuration requirements (Cloud Infrastructure Admin)
- PublicIP pool management

### Storage

What storage integration does the feature require?

- Prerequisites (e.g., VAST storage accessible from hub cluster)
- StorageTier API resources
- Automated provisioning during tenant onboarding (credentials, CSIDriver, StorageClass)
- Per-cluster / per-tenant VAST view creation
- Disk attachment to compute instances

### Installation

How does the feature affect deployment and installation?

- Changes to Helm charts or kustomize manifests
- CI pipeline implications
- New prerequisites or dependencies
- `osac-installer/setup.sh` updates needed

### E2E Testing

What E2E test coverage does the feature require in osac-test-infra (bootstrapped at `osac-test-infra/`)?

- Which user-visible flows must work for this milestone (happy path, error paths, edge cases)?
- Which API surfaces need E2E coverage via pytest (Fulfillment API, CRDs, catalog/templates)?
- Are there cross-service test scenarios (e.g., provisioning + networking)?
- What test infrastructure is required (pytest fixtures, env/config, test tenants/organizations)?

### Documentation

What user-facing documentation does the feature require?

- What user-facing documentation is needed (user guides, API reference, architecture docs)?
- Which persona workflows need documented?
- Are there docs repo updates needed (`docs/`, `enhancement-proposals/`)?
- Is documentation in scope for this milestone or explicitly deferred?
- Does the feature change existing documented workflows that need updating?

## User-Facing API

For each service in scope, identify which API surfaces the feature affects.
Detailed API design (field names, resource schemas, new states) belongs in the
design document — the PRD should focus on which surfaces are touched and why.

- **Fulfillment API** (gRPC/REST) — which resources are affected?
- **OSAC CRDs** (Kubernetes) — which custom resources are affected?
- **Catalog Items** — does the feature introduce or change catalog entries?

## Milestone Scoping

When writing a PRD or design, explicitly declare:

- **Target milestone** (e.g., 0.1, 0.2)
- **What's NOT covered** — dimensions or capabilities deferred to a later milestone (e.g., "No Networking API integration in 0.1", "No Storage API in 0.1")
- **Known risks and gaps** — dependencies, DNS requirements, third-party onboarding, etc.
- **Upgrades** — OSAC does not currently support upgrades, so data migration and backward compatibility are not concerns at this stage. State this explicitly if applicable.
