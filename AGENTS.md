# OSAC Workspace

Meta-workspace that bootstraps all OSAC (Open Sovereign AI Cloud) component repos for cross-component development, testing, and AI-assisted workflows. OSAC is a fulfillment system for provisioning Kubernetes clusters and compute instances with networking capabilities. Primary languages: Go, YAML, Python. Primary tools: kubectl, jira CLI, gh CLI.

## Critical Rules

- **`osac-workspace/` is the project root** — all work happens from here; component docs are loaded via progressive disclosure
- **Never skip tenant isolation metadata** (`osac.openshift.io/tenant`, `osac.openshift.io/owner-reference` annotations) in new resources
- **Always `buf lint` before committing** proto changes; regenerate with `buf generate`
- **Fork-based workflow**: always push to `fork` remote, never to `origin`. PRs go from `fork/<branch>` to `origin/main`
- **AI attribution**: use `Assisted-by: Claude Code <noreply@anthropic.com>` trailer on commits — never use `Co-Authored-By` for AI tools (Red Hat attribution standard)
- When debugging Kubernetes operators, check for stale vendor directories and cached images before rebuilding

## Dev Environment

### Option A: Distrobox (recommended)

All dev tools are packaged in a Fedora 42 container (`Containerfile`). Requires `podman` and `distrobox`.

```bash
make enter                     # Build image and enter distrobox
make status                    # Check image and distrobox status
make rebuild                   # Rebuild image from scratch
```

### Option B: Local toolchain

Install Go, Node.js, buf, kubectl, kind, jira CLI, gh CLI directly.

### Bootstrap

```bash
./bootstrap.sh                 # Clone all repos with fork setup (requires gh CLI)
./bootstrap.sh --no-fork       # Clone read-only without forking
```

Re-run `./bootstrap.sh` anytime to update all repos to latest `main`.

## Repository Structure

Meta-workspace — run `./bootstrap.sh` to clone/update all component repos to latest `main`. **In component repos, read `CLAUDE.md` first** (progressive disclosure). Use that component's `AGENTS.md` where the table below shows **Yes** for tool-agnostic build/test conventions.

Note: `fulfillment-api` and `fulfillment-common` were merged into `fulfillment-service`.

| Component | Description | AGENTS.md |

| [`bare-metal-fulfillment-operator`](https://github.com/osac-project/bare-metal-fulfillment-operator) | Kubernetes operator for bare metal fulfillment | Yes |

## Build and Test

This workspace has no build step of its own. Each component repo documents build and test commands in its `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md`.

| Component              | Build                              | Unit Tests               | Lint                       |
|------------------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------|
| `fulfillment-service/` | `go build`                         | `ginkgo run -r internal` | `uv run dev.py lint`       |
| `osac-operator/`       | `make build`                       | `make test`              | `make lint`                |
| `osac-aap/`            | —                                  | —                        | `ansible-lint`             |
| `osac-installer/`      | `kustomize build overlays/<name>`  | —                        | `yamllint --strict .`      |
| `osac-test-infra/`     | —                                  | —                        | `pre-commit run --all-files` |
| `osac-ui/`             | `pnpm build`                       | `pnpm test`              | `pnpm lint`                |

### Quick Reference

```bash
# fulfillment-service
cd fulfillment-service
go build                              # Build
ginkgo run -r internal                # Unit tests (excludes integration)
ginkgo run it                         # Integration tests (requires kind)
IT_KEEP_KIND=true ginkgo run it       # Preserve kind cluster for debugging
buf lint && buf generate              # Proto lint + codegen

# osac-operator
cd osac-operator
make image-build image-push IMG=<registry>/osac-operator:tag
make install                          # Install CRDs
make deploy IMG=<registry>/osac-operator:tag
```

### CI

The workspace itself runs one GitHub Actions workflow:
- `pr-dashboard.yml` — generates a PR dashboard (runs on schedule, deploys to GitHub Pages via `tools/pr-notify/generate.py`)

Component repos have their own CI pipelines.

## Code Style

### Git Workflow

- **Fork-based**: push to `fork` remote, never to `origin`. PRs go from `fork/<branch>` to `origin/main`.
- **Branch naming**: `<type>/<ticket-or-description>` (e.g., `feat/OSAC-23607`, `fix/duplicate-aap-jobs`)
- **Remotes**: `origin` = upstream osac-project (read-only), `fork` = developer fork (push target)
- **DCO sign-off**: `git commit -s` on all commits
- **AI attribution**: `Assisted-by: Claude Code <noreply@anthropic.com>` trailer — never `Co-Authored-By` for AI tools

### Cross-Component Changes

When a feature spans repos, merge in dependency order:
1. `fulfillment-service` (proto definitions)
2. `osac-operator` (CRD types, controllers)
3. `osac-aap` (Ansible roles/playbooks)
4. `osac-installer` (submodules, deployment manifests)

Link PRs in descriptions: "Depends on fulfillment-service#123".

## Deployment Coordination

`osac-installer/setup.sh` pins component versions (AAP collections, fulfillment-service images) via submodule refs. When making changes that cross component boundaries, always update `osac-installer` to match:

- **Proto field additions** in `fulfillment-service` → update CI overlays in `osac-installer` to use the new image version
- **New AAP roles or collections** in `osac-aap` → bump the submodule ref in `osac-installer`
- **New CRD types** in `osac-operator` → register in the fulfillment-service reconciler

Failing to update `osac-installer` after cross-component changes causes CI failures and deployment mismatches. See `.planning/codebase/CONVENTIONS.md` for the full cross-repo dependency table.

## Enhancement Proposals

OSAC uses the flightctl ai-workflows PRD and design skills with project-level template overrides in `.design/templates/`. The two-stage flow produces a PRD followed by a design document.

### Docs Repo

- Both PRD and design workflows publish to the `enhancement-proposals` repo
- Local path: `./enhancement-proposals/`
- When the publish phase asks for the docs repo, provide this path

### File Path Conventions

When publishing PRDs and design documents to the enhancement-proposals repo:

- Skip the "release" question — use `enhancements` as the fixed directory prefix
- Feature directory: `enhancements/<feature-slug>/` (e.g., `enhancements/storage-network/`)
- PRD filename: `prd.md`
- Design (EP) filename: `design.md`
- Both files live in the same directory: `enhancements/<slug>/prd.md` and `enhancements/<slug>/design.md`

### Fork-Based Workflow

Push to the `fork` remote in the enhancement-proposals repo, not `origin`. PRs go from `fork/<branch>` to `origin/main`.

### Feature Dimensions Context

Both PRD and design ingest phases must read all files in `.design/context/`:

- **`osac-dimensions.md`** — Cross-cutting dimensions (services, personas, tenant onboarding, inventory, provisioning, networking, storage, installation, E2E testing, documentation, UI) that every OSAC feature must address. Use it to guide clarifying questions during PRD clarify and persona/user-story scope during PRD draft (see Personas and `osac-docs/personas.md`); ensure the design covers all relevant dimensions.
- **`review-patterns.md`** — Common design reviewer feedback themes, anti-patterns, and the design reference library. Use during PRD draft and design draft to anticipate reviewer expectations.

### Component Conventions

Design and implement ingest phases must read the `AGENTS.md` of each component repo affected by the feature. These contain authoritative conventions for API design, database patterns, testing, and build tooling that the generic workspace rules summarize but do not replace.

For features involving the fulfillment-service API (proto definitions, services, request/response patterns), `fulfillment-service/AGENTS.md` points to [`fulfillment-service/docs/API.md`](fulfillment-service/docs/API.md) — the canonical API design guidelines. Read it before drafting or reviewing proto schemas.

### Template Overrides

- Design template: `.design/templates/design.md` (EP format with PRD-aware modifications)
- Design section guidance: `.design/templates/section-guidance.md`
- PRD template: `.prd/templates/prd.md` (user stories by persona, In Scope/Out of Scope instead of FR-N/NFR-N)

## Jira Conventions

- OSAC uses Jira **Tasks** (not Stories) for implementation work — in the **implement** workflow, "story" references mean Tasks in this project
- Use `jira` CLI for Jira access (e.g., `jira issue view OSAC-1234 --plain`), not Jira MCP
- Planning artifacts live in `.planning/`

## AI-Assisted Workflows

See [`AI-assisted-development-workflow.md`](AI-assisted-development-workflow.md) for the full workflow: Feature → PRD → Design → Jira sync → Implement.

Installed via `bootstrap.sh` from [flightctl/ai-workflows](https://github.com/flightctl/ai-workflows). Available in Claude Code, Cursor, and other AI tools (command syntax varies by tool).

### Development Workflows

- **bugfix** — Systematic bug fix: assess → reproduce → diagnose → fix → test → review → document → pr
- **implement** — Task-to-code: ingest Jira task → plan → code (TDD) → validate → publish PR

Both workflows are phase-based — you can jump to any phase directly (e.g., `bugfix:fix`, `implement:code`).

### PRD and Design Workflows

Two-stage enhancement proposal flow. See the Enhancement Proposals section above for docs repo, file path conventions, and templates.

**Stage 1 — PRD:** ingest → clarify → draft → publish → respond

**Stage 2 — Design (EP):** ingest → draft → publish → respond → decompose → sync

**Single-step (legacy):** `/ep.create` (registered legacy skill name; see `CLAUDE.md` for Claude command syntax)

### E2E Test Workflows

Two complementary skills for E2E tests, available from the `osac-workspace/` root:

- **e2e** (ai-workflows) — Full story-to-test workflow: `/e2e:ingest` a Jira [QE] story → `/e2e:plan` scenarios → `/e2e:code` tests → `/e2e:validate` → `/e2e:publish` PR. Framework-agnostic — discovers osac-test-infra's pytest patterns during ingest.
- **debug-e2e** (osac-test-infra) — Debug a failing Prow CI job using build logs and gathered OSAC artifacts. Use after tests exist and fail in CI.

The `/e2e` workflow writes tests in `osac-test-infra/tests/` following the conventions in `osac-test-infra/.claude/skills/e2e.md` (gRPC client patterns, K8s client patterns, wait helpers, pytest fixtures). The `/debug-e2e` skill reads Prow logs and OSAC gathered artifacts to diagnose failures.

### Skill discovery

Canonical skill definitions live in `skills/` (committed OSAC skills plus bootstrap-managed ai-workflows symlinks). Run `./bootstrap.sh` to wire skill discovery for each agent:

| Agent | Skill path | Phase commands |
|-------|------------|----------------|
| Claude Code | `.claude/skills/` → `skills/` | `.claude/commands/` (ai-workflows) |
| Cursor | `.cursor/skills/` → `skills/` | `.cursor/commands/` (ai-workflows) |
| Gemini CLI | `.gemini/skills/` → `skills/` | — |
| GitHub Copilot | `AGENTS.md` conventions only | — |

`.claude/`, `.cursor/`, and `.gemini/` are gitignored except project settings; bootstrap recreates agent skill symlinks via `tools/link-agent-skills.sh`.

### Skillsaw Linting

**Skillsaw linting** (version pinned in `Makefile` `SKILLSAW_VERSION`; scope is `skillsaw lint .` with blacklist via `.skillsaw.yaml` `exclude:`; strict lint only — no baseline file, see `.gitignore`):

- `make skillsaw` — lint full repo (on-demand; applies `SKILLSAW_VERSION`, `--strict`, `--no-baseline`)
- `make skillsaw SKILL=skills/<name>/` — lint one skill (same pin and flags; no bare `skillsaw` on PATH)
- Keep `Makefile`'s `SKILLSAW_VERSION` and `.github/workflows/skillsaw.yml`'s `version:` input in sync when bumping.
- **CI** — `stbenjam/skillsaw` action on PRs (same `.skillsaw.yaml`; fixed command, not `Makefile`); `skillsaw-review` workflow posts inline PR comments from the lint report (no PR code execution in the review job)

Skillsaw enforces [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/specification) structure (frontmatter, naming) and content quality heuristics. **Do not rewrite skill semantics just to pass lint** — tune `.skillsaw.yaml` for false positives or fix with backticks (see below).

### Skill Authoring Conventions

OSAC skills are workspace operators, not isolated skill bundles:

- **Context budget:** Keep `SKILL.md` body under **5,000 tokens** ([Agent Skills spec](https://agentskills.io/specification) Tier 2). Move reference material to `references/` or `steps/` and link from `SKILL.md` with explicit **read before** callouts at each workflow step.

| Reference type | Format | Example |
|----------------|--------|---------|
| File inside the skill directory | Markdown link ([Agent Skills spec](https://agentskills.io/specification)) | `[preflight.md](steps/preflight.md)` |
| Path at workspace repo root | Backtick path, not a markdown link | `` `presentations/themes/redhat.css` `` |
| Component or external doc | Backtick path or full URL | `` `fulfillment-service/docs/API.md` `` |
| User-input markers in examples | Backtick the marker | `` `TODO:` `` in meeting notes (not bare `TODO` in headings) |
| Bad examples in calibration text | Backtick the quoted phrase | `` `handle edge cases appropriately` `` |

Put `CRITICAL` / `IMPORTANT` rules in the first 20% of `SKILL.md` (skillsaw `content-critical-position`). When stating a prohibition, include the required alternative (for example: do Y instead of X). When lint forces a trade-off between passing and preserving operational guidance, preserve the guidance and adjust config or formatting.

## Architecture

```text
fulfillment-service    gRPC/REST API server, PostgreSQL, resource lifecycle
osac-operator          Kubernetes operator, provisions via AAP + Hosted Control Planes
osac-aap               Ansible playbooks for VM and network provisioning
osac-installer         Kustomize overlays, deploys all components to OpenShift
osac-test-infra        E2E test playbooks against fulfillment-service gRPC API
osac-ui                Web console (React, PatternFly 6, pnpm workspace)
enhancement-proposals  Design documents and RFCs
osac-docs              Architecture docs and guides
```

### Resource Hierarchy

```text
Tenant → namespace and network isolation
ClusterOrder → OpenShift clusters via Hosted Control Planes
VirtualNetwork → L2 network with CIDR (child of NetworkClass)
  ├── Subnet → CIDR range within VirtualNetwork
  └── SecurityGroup → firewall rules
ComputeInstance → KubeVirt VM, attached to Subnets + SecurityGroups
PublicIPPool → IP address ranges
  └── PublicIP → allocated from pool, attached to ComputeInstance
```

### Operator Architecture (osac-operator)

The osac-operator uses controller-runtime to reconcile OSAC custom resources on Kubernetes. Key patterns:

- **All controllers follow the same reconciliation pattern**: finalizer → status update → provisioning/deprovisioning lifecycle
- **Shared provisioning lifecycle**: Controllers use `provisioning.RunProvisioningLifecycle()` for provision and manual deprovision handling
- **CRD types**: ClusterOrder, ComputeInstance, Tenant, VirtualNetwork, Subnet, SecurityGroup, PublicIPPool, PublicIP
- **Multi-cluster support**: Controllers use `multicluster-runtime` for management/workload cluster separation
- **Management-state annotation**: All controllers should check `osac.openshift.io/management-state` and skip reconciliation when set to `Unmanaged`
- **Namespace isolation**: Networking controllers filter to a configured namespace via `NetworkingNamespacePredicate`

When fixing bugs or adding features, **check all controllers** that follow the same pattern — a bug in one controller likely exists in others. A missing feature in one controller is also a bug if all controllers are expected to behave consistently.

## UI Reference (osac-ux)

`osac-ux/` is cloned read-only from [osac-project/osac-ux](https://github.com/osac-project/osac-ux).
No PRs are created against it from backend workflow sessions (no `fork` remote).

### What to read during /design:research and /implement:ingest

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `osac-ux/libs/ui-components/src/pages/tenant/` | Tenant screens — form fields, list columns, actions |
| `osac-ux/libs/ui-components/src/pages/provider/` | Provider admin screens |
| `osac-ux/libs/ui-components/src/pages/admin/` | Tenant admin screens |
| `osac-ux/libs/ui-components/src/api/v1/` | @temp-api types — use as primary proto field input |
| `osac-ux/apps/e2e/cypress/e2e/flows/` | User journeys for Cypress scenario planning |

### @temp-api types are primary proto input

For **any EP** (new resource or existing resource enhancement), check whether
a matching `@temp-api` file exists at `osac-ux/libs/ui-components/src/api/v1/<resource>.ts`.
If it does, read it and use the TypeScript fields as the source for proto field names
(converting camelCase → snake_case). The EP must include a `## UX Alignment` section
with a field-by-field mapping table and a justification for any deviation.

For existing resources, the @temp-api file may contain fields the UI needs but the
backend has not yet returned — these are real requirements, not speculation.

### API coverage audit (one-time and on-demand)

To surface the full backlog of existing API gaps against the current UI, run:

```bash
cd osac-ux && node scripts/gen-api-diff.mjs
```

This compares all live UI routes against the backend OpenAPI spec and lists
uncovered or mismatched fields. Use the output as input when scoping EP work,
not as a file to commit or reference statically.

### Known deviations — flag these in the EP, do not copy from @temp-api

| @temp-api pattern | Correct fulfillment-service design |
|---|---|
| Sub-resource actions: `POST .../attach`, `POST .../restore` | Standalone `*_attachments` resource (pattern: `public_ip_attachments`) |
| `storageClass: 'ssd' \| 'nvme' \| 'standard'` string union | `storage_tier_id: string` reference to StorageTier resource |
| `spec.storageClassName`, `spec.storageBackend` in StorageTier | Private API only — omit from public proto |
| `status.secretAccessKey?: string` on create response | Separate `Create*Response` proto message |
| `AiEnvironment.spec.rhoaiVersion`, `gatewayEndpoint` | RHOAI operator fields — verify these belong in public API before adding |

## Common Fix Locations (fulfillment-service)

Use this table to go directly to the right file for common bug patterns instead of grepping from scratch:

| Bug pattern | File(s) to check |
|-------------|-----------------|
| `unknown object type` or unhandled type in switch | `internal/servers/generic_server.go` — `setPayload()` switch statement |
| Public API missing field (Create/Update not persisting a field) | `internal/servers/*_server.go` — `Create()` and `Update()` methods |
| Table rendering missing or incorrect column | `internal/rendering/tables/*.yaml` — table definition files |

## OpenShift Deployment

```bash
kubectl annotate ingresses.config/cluster ingress.operator.openshift.io/default-enable-http2=true
kubectl apply -k fulfillment-service/manifests
export token=$(kubectl create token -n osac client)
export route=$(kubectl get route -n osac fulfillment-api -o json | jq -r '.spec.host')
grpcurl -insecure -H "Authorization: Bearer ${token}" ${route}:443 fulfillment.v1.VirtualNetworks/List
```
