# OSAC Review Patterns

Common review feedback patterns from past OSAC PRD and EP submissions. Both
`/prd:draft` and `/design:draft` should anticipate these expectations when
producing documents.

## PRD vs Design: What Goes Where

| PRD (`prd.md`) | Design EP (`design.md`) |
|----------------|------------------------|
| User stories per persona | CRD fields, conditions, finalizers |
| Observable outcomes | Controller reconcile logic |
| Non-goals, assumptions, risks | Playbook names, API schemas |
| High-level affected surfaces | Helm/installer implementation |

**Litmus test:** could a persona observe or experience this directly? If yes,
it belongs in the PRD. If no, it belongs in the design.

## Reviewer Expectations

### PRD Expectations
- User stories should cover all relevant OSAC personas (see `osac-dimensions.md`)
- Requirements describe user-observable outcomes, not implementation
- No API fields, controller names, playbook names, or env vars
- Acceptance criteria are PM-verifiable scenarios, not engineering checklists
- Optional sections are omitted (not filled with placeholders)

### Design EP Expectations
- All template sections must be present, even if marked "TBD" or "N/A"
- Implementation details should be thorough (successful EPs are 400-800 lines)
- Test plans should describe strategy, not just "tests will be added"

### Clarity
- Technical terms should be defined upfront (see Networking EP's Terminology section)
- Relationships between resources should be explicit (parent-child, ownership, scope)
- Workflows should enumerate steps with actor roles clearly defined

### Consistency with OSAC Patterns
- New APIs should be declarative, following [Kubernetes API conventions](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md) where possible
- Resources should include tenant isolation metadata (annotations for tenant-id, owner-reference)
- Controller patterns should align with osac-operator conventions
- Integration with osac-aap should be described for provisioning workflows
- Pluggable architectures (like NetworkClass) are preferred over hardcoded implementations

## Frequent Feedback Themes

| Theme | Anti-Pattern | Better Approach |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| Missing alternatives | No "Alternatives" section or only strawman options | Explain other approaches considered and why they were rejected |
| Vague non-goals | "Advanced features are out of scope" | "Auto-scaling and multi-region placement are out of scope — addressed in a separate proposal" |
| Implementation-focused user stories | "As a tenant, I want the VirtualNetwork CRD to have a CIDR field" | "As a tenant, I want to define an isolated network with my own IP address space so I can control my network topology" |
| Design leakage in PRD | PRD names controllers, CRD fields, playbooks, env vars, or finalizers | PRD states user-observable outcomes; design doc specifies implementation |
| Acceptance criteria repeat requirements | AC checkboxes restate each FR as "FR-N is implemented" | AC describes end-to-end scenarios a PM can verify by using the product |
| Placeholder test plans | "Unit and integration tests will be added" | "Unit tests for proto validation and CIDR parsing; integration tests for VirtualNetwork creation and Subnet attachment; e2e tests for full networking stack" |
| Generic risks | "Risk: Implementation might have bugs" | "Risk: IPv6 dual-stack adds testing complexity. Mitigation: Make IPv6 optional, support IPv4-only mode" |
| Inconsistent terminology | "Floating IP" / "PublicIP" / "External IP" used interchangeably | Define terms in a Terminology section and use consistently |
| Workflow gaps | Jumps from creation to deletion | Include all lifecycle operations (create, read, update, delete, start/stop) |

## EP Reference Library

Existing EPs as quality benchmarks:

| Slug | Description | Lines | Notable Patterns |
|------|-------------|-------|------------------|
| `networking` | Networking API with VirtualNetwork, Subnet, SecurityGroup, PublicIP | 818 | Terminology section, dual-stack IPv4/IPv6, NetworkClass pluggable architecture |
| `bare-metal-fulfillment` | Bare metal provisioning with HostPool, Host, HostClass | ~400 | ESI integration, serial console, network attachment at interface level |
| `vmaas` | VM as a Service with ComputeInstance and ComputeInstanceTemplate | ~300 | Template-based provisioning, GPU support, live migration |
| `organizations` | Multi-tenancy organization model | ~300 | Tenant isolation, RBAC patterns |
| `tenant-specific-storageclasses` | Tenant-scoped storage class management | ~200 | Provider/tenant resource split pattern |
| `computeinstance-phase-condition-expansion` | ComputeInstance status and lifecycle updates | ~200 | API evolution pattern for existing resources |

Key takeaways:
- All EPs follow the template structure exactly (no skipped sections)
- Successful EPs define terminology upfront and use it consistently

## Review Process

- Address each comment explicitly (update the proposal or explain why not)
- Don't resolve comments yourself — let the reviewer resolve after confirming
- Update `last-updated` frontmatter field when making changes
- If architectural disagreement stalls the PR, escalate to synchronous discussion
