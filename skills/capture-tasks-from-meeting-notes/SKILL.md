# Capture Tasks from Meeting Notes

## Overview

Automatically extract action items from meeting notes and create Jira tasks with proper assignees using `jira-cli`. This skill parses unstructured meeting notes (pasted text), identifies action items with assignees, and creates tasks — eliminating the tedious post-meeting ticket creation process.

**Use this skill when:** Users have meeting notes with action items that need to become Jira tasks.

All commands use `--plain` for clean output and `--no-input` to skip interactive prompts.

---

## Workflow

**CRITICAL:** Always present parsed action items to the user and wait for confirmation before creating tasks (Step 4).

Follow this 6-step process to turn meeting notes into actionable Jira tasks:

### Step 1: Get Meeting Notes

Obtain the meeting notes from the user. Ask them to paste the notes directly.

If unclear, ask: "Could you paste the meeting notes here?"

---

### Step 2: Parse Action Items

Scan the notes for action items with assignees.

#### Common Patterns

**Pattern 1: @mention format** (highest priority)
```
@Sarah to create user stories for chat feature
@Mike will update architecture doc
```

**Pattern 2: Name + action verb**
```
Sarah to create user stories
Mike will update architecture doc
Lisa should review the mockups
```

**Pattern 3: Action: Name - Task**
```
Action: Sarah - create user stories
Action Item: Mike - update architecture
```

**Pattern 4: Action-item marker with assignee**
```
TODO: Create user stories (Sarah)
TODO: Update docs - Mike
```

**Pattern 5: Bullet with name**
```
- Sarah: create user stories
- Mike - update architecture
```

#### Extraction Logic

**For each action item, extract:**

1. **Assignee Name** — Text after @ symbol, name before "to"/"will"/"should", name after "Action:" or in parentheses
2. **Task Description** — Text after "to", "will", "should", "-", ":"
3. **Context** (optional) — Meeting title/date, surrounding discussion context

---

### Step 3: Confirm Project and Epic

Before creating tasks, identify the target Jira project and epic.

**Ask:** "Which Jira project and epic should I create these tasks in? (e.g., project OSAC, epic OSAC-12345)"

If the user is unsure about the project, list available projects:

```bash
jira project list --plain
```

---

### Step 4: Present Action Items

Show the parsed action items using the format below, then wait for confirmation.

```
I found [N] action items from the meeting notes. Should I create these Jira tasks in [PROJECT] under epic [EPIC-KEY]?

1. [Task description]
   Assigned to: [Name]

2. [Task description]
   Assigned to: [Name]

Would you like me to:
1. Create all tasks
2. Skip some tasks (which ones?)
3. Modify any descriptions or assignees
```

#### Wait for Confirmation

Do NOT create tasks until user confirms.

---

### Step 5: Create Tasks

Once confirmed, create each Jira task using the Safe create pattern in `jira-task-management` (source `tools/jira-safe-create.sh` once, then `new_temp` + `add_temp` per task).

#### For Each Action Item

```bash
# Once before the loop (if not already sourced):
source "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/tools/jira-safe-create.sh"

BODY=$(new_temp osac-task-body)
add_temp "$BODY"
OUT=$(new_temp osac-jira-out)
add_temp "$OUT"
ERR=$(new_temp osac-jira-err)
add_temp "$ERR"

cat >"$BODY" <<'EOF'
**Action Item from Meeting Notes**

**Task:** Original action item text

**Context:**
Meeting title/date
Relevant discussion points
EOF

jira issue create -tTask \
  -s "Task description" \
  --template "$BODY" \
  -P <EPIC-KEY> -a <assignee> --no-input --raw >"$OUT" 2>"$ERR" </dev/null

KEY=$(jq -r '.key // empty' "$OUT")
# On empty key or failure: cat "$ERR" >&2
```

#### Task Summary Format

Use action verbs and be specific:
- "Create user stories for chat feature"
- "Update architecture documentation"
- "Review and approve design mockups"

#### Handling Assignee Lookup

The `-a` flag expects a Jira username or email. If you only have a first name from the notes:
- Ask the user for the full username/email
- Or create the task unassigned and note: "Please assign manually"

---

### Step 6: Provide Summary

After all tasks are created, present a comprehensive summary.

```
Created [N] tasks in [PROJECT]:

1. [PROJ-123] - [Task summary]
   Assigned to: [Name]
   https://redhat.atlassian.net/browse/PROJ-123

2. [PROJ-124] - [Task summary]
   Assigned to: [Name]
   https://redhat.atlassian.net/browse/PROJ-124

Next Steps:
- Review tasks in Jira for accuracy
- Add any additional details or attachments
- Adjust priorities if needed
```

---

## Handling Edge Cases

### No Action Items Found

If no action items with assignees are detected:

```
I analyzed the meeting notes but couldn't find any action items with clear assignees.

Action items typically follow patterns like:
- @Name to do X
- Name will do X
- Action: Name - do X

Options:
1. I can search for TODO items without assignees
2. You can point out specific action items to create
```

### Mixed Formats (Some With Assignees, Some Without)

```
I found [N] action items:
- [X] with clear assignees
- [Y] without assignees

Should I:
1. Create all [N] tasks ([X] assigned, [Y] unassigned)
2. Only create the [X] tasks with assignees
3. Ask you to assign the [Y] unassigned tasks
```

### Duplicate Action Items

If the same task appears multiple times, flag it and ask whether to create one or two tasks.

## When NOT to Use This Skill

**Don't use for:**
- Summarizing meetings (no task creation)
- General Jira task creation (use jira-task-management)
- Creating epics or stories from specs (use spec-to-backlog)

**Use only when:** Meeting notes exist and action items need to become Jira tasks.
