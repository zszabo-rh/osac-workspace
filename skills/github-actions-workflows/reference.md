# Reference: GitHub Actions Gotchas

Detailed backup for [SKILL.md](SKILL.md)'s checklist. Read this when you hit
the specific situation, not proactively.

## Semver regex

Official semver.org grammar, adapted with a required `v` prefix. Rejects
leading zeros (`v01.2.3`, `v1.2.3-01`) and accepts hyphenated
prerelease/build identifiers (`v5.0.0-rc-1`, `v1.2.3-alpha.1`):

```bash
semver_re='^v(0|[1-9][0-9]*)\.(0|[1-9][0-9]*)\.(0|[1-9][0-9]*)(-((0|[1-9][0-9]*)|[0-9A-Za-z-]*[A-Za-z-][0-9A-Za-z-]*)(\.((0|[1-9][0-9]*)|[0-9A-Za-z-]*[A-Za-z-][0-9A-Za-z-]*))*)?(\+[0-9A-Za-z-]+(\.[0-9A-Za-z-]+)*)?$'
```

If the tag is later used verbatim as a **container image tag**, drop the
trailing `(\+[0-9A-Za-z-]+(\.[0-9A-Za-z-]+)*)?` group entirely - Docker/OCI
tags cannot contain `+`, so a tag like `v1.2.3+build.1` would pass this regex
but produce an unusable image reference downstream. The
[#workflow_run-gate-pattern](#workflow_run-gate-pattern) template uses that
image-tag-safe form on purpose. Use the same grammar without the `v` prefix
when validating an already-stripped version string.

## Stale reusable-workflow pins

Found on `osac-installer`'s `nightly-build.yaml`: it pinned
`osac-test-infra/.github/workflows/e2e-vmaas-full-install.yml@<sha>  # main`
once, when the nightly workflow was first added. Two weeks later,
`osac-test-infra` restructured that reusable workflow (to track an unrelated
install-path change upstream) - but the pin, never revisited, kept every
nightly run on the old copy. It failed outright once the old copy's install
step referenced a script the upstream change had deleted, and nothing
caught the drift in those two weeks: `osac-installer`'s *own*
`.github/dependabot.yml` already had `package-ecosystem: "github-actions"`
configured, but Dependabot's action/reusable-workflow updater resolves new
versions against the target repo's **tags/releases** - `osac-test-infra` has
none, so there was never a "new version" for it to open a PR against, even
though `osac-test-infra`'s `main` moved dozens of commits past the pin.

The general shape: a SHA pin bought immutability at the moment it was
written, but "immutable" and "current" are different properties, and only
one of them degrades safely by default. A sibling caller in the same repo
that referenced the identical reusable workflow via `@main` (unpinned)
picked up the fix automatically and was unaffected - which is a useful
diagnostic in itself: if one caller of a pinned dependency is broken and
another unpinned caller of the *same* dependency isn't, staleness is the
first thing to check, before assuming the two call sites differ in some
other way.

Two fixes, not one - re-pinning the immediate break is necessary but not
sufficient:

1. **Bump the stale pin** to the target repo's current branch tip.
2. **Add (or extend) a scheduled bot** that keeps re-resolving and bumping
   it, rather than leaving the new pin to go stale the exact same way. If
   the repo already runs a similar scheduled bump bot for something else
   (e.g. a submodule-bump workflow), extend that one instead of adding a
   second, parallel scheduled job - one bot, one cadence, one PR/branch, is
   easier to reason about than two near-identical bots drifting out of sync
   with each other. Validate the resolved SHA is a real 40-hex commit before
   rewriting anything with it (an empty/`null` API response - e.g. a typo'd
   repo name, or a transient failure - must abort, not silently write `@`
   with nothing after it into every matching file), and check *every*
   distinct pin in a given file, not just the first match, so a file with
   multiple references to the same pinned repo gets fully updated in one
   pass rather than needing a second bot run to catch the rest.

## Documented endpoints

"Empirically works" and "officially documented" aren't the same thing, and
only the second is guaranteed to keep working. Example that actually bit us:
GitHub's "Get a reference" endpoint is documented as **singular**
`GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/git/ref/{ref}`; the **plural** form
(`git/refs/{ref}`) is only documented for `PATCH`/`DELETE`. Both currently
return identical data for `GET` - but verify against the actual docs
(`https://docs.github.com/en/rest/git/refs`) before relying on undocumented
behavior, empirical testing alone isn't enough.

## Incomplete must not look clean

A failed fetch / partial listing / timed-out search must not report the same
as "scanned, nothing found." Keep separate flags (e.g. `SCAN_OK` vs
`LEAKS_FOUND`). Before trusting emptiness:

```bash
# Require a real array, not null / missing
jq -e '.items | type == "array"' "$RESP" >/dev/null

# Require numeric counts before comparing
jq -e '(.total_count | type) == "number"' "$RESP" >/dev/null

# Some search endpoints set incomplete_results on timeout
jq -e '.incomplete_results != true' "$RESP" >/dev/null
```

Treat `incomplete_results: true`, truncated pagination, or a malformed item
(when you lack a per-item skip counter) as incomplete — bump a skipped /
failed counter and surface it in summaries — never as a clean pass. Related:
[fail loud on per-item batch failures](#fail-loud-on-per-item-batch-failures)
and [detection vs remediation](#detection-vs-remediation-status).

## Dereferencing annotated tags

`GET git/ref/tags/<tag>` returns the tag *object's* SHA for annotated tags,
not the commit SHA - comparing it directly against a commit SHA will always
mismatch. Peel it with a second call:

```bash
ref_json="$(gh api "repos/${REPO}/git/ref/tags/${TAG}" --jq '[.object.type, .object.sha] | @tsv')"
read -r current_type current_sha <<< "$ref_json"
if [[ "$current_type" == "tag" ]]; then
  current_sha="$(gh api "repos/${REPO}/git/tags/${current_sha}" --jq .object.sha)"
fi
```

Note `ref_json` is captured *before* `read` - see the checklist item on
`gh api`-into-`read` masking.

## Tag immutability

Re-checking a tag's SHA right before publishing (see
[#workflow_run-gate-pattern](#workflow_run-gate-pattern)) is defense in
depth, not a guarantee - there's still a window between the last check and
the actual publish/release call where a tag could be force-moved.
`gh release create --verify-tag` does not close that window either: it only
confirms the tag *exists* at release-creation time, it does not re-check
*which commit* it points at.

The structural fix is twofold — immutability *and* who may create the tag:

- **Restrict `v*` tag creation** to authorized release actors (ruleset
  targeting tags, or equivalent branch/tag protection). Immutability alone
  stops later moves; it does **not** stop an unauthorized first push of a
  release tag.
- **Tag-protection ruleset**: block force-pushes/deletions on matching refs
  (Settings -> Rules -> Rulesets). Pair with create-restrictions above.
- **Immutable releases** (GitHub feature, rolling out): once a release is
  marked immutable, its underlying tag is locked for the release's lifetime
  — it can't be force-moved even by someone with push access, unlike a
  ruleset which is more broadly bypassable by anyone with ruleset-bypass
  permissions.

If create-restriction / immutability is not enabled, say so explicitly when
proposing this gate pattern - don't let the SHA re-checks imply a stronger
guarantee than they actually provide.

## workflow_run privilege escalation

The classic `workflow_run` risk (see GitHub's own
[Actions Security Lab writeups](https://securitylab.github.com/resources/github-actions-new-patterns-and-mitigations/)):
an unprivileged workflow triggered by `pull_request` (which can run on an
untrusted fork's code with a read-only token) completes, then a *privileged*
`workflow_run` job - with `contents: write`/`secrets` access - checks out
and executes that same untrusted code, effectively laundering it into a
privileged context.

The gate pattern in this skill checks out the repo's own tagged source
(pushed by someone who already had write access to create the tag), not an
untrusted contribution, so that specific escalation path doesn't apply to
it directly. But if you adapt the pattern to gate on a workflow that *can*
be triggered by an untrusted contribution (most commonly: one that also
runs on `pull_request` from forks), don't carry over the "just check out
and build in the privileged job" shape unchanged:

- Don't check out or execute the contributor's code in the privileged job.
- Treat anything the upstream (unprivileged) run produced - artifacts,
  outputs - as untrusted data; verify or attest it rather than trusting it.
- Keep real build/compile steps in the unprivileged workflow; let the
  privileged job do only release-specific work (tagging, publishing
  already-built/verified artifacts).

## workflow_dispatch branch restriction

A related but distinct escalation shape from the `workflow_run` one above,
found on `osac-test-infra` PR #182: `workflow_dispatch` lets anyone with
write access to the repo pick *any* branch or tag to run the workflow
against, and GitHub executes *that ref's own copy* of the workflow file -
not the default branch's. If the job being dispatched is privileged (Vault
secrets, an org-scoped token, `contents: write`, etc.), this lets that
person push a modified copy of the workflow to a throwaway branch - e.g.
with a same-file guard like `if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'` simply
deleted - and then dispatch against that branch to run their version with
the job's full privileges, bypassing whatever review gate protects the
default branch.

```yaml
# INSUFFICIENT - lives in the same file the invoker controls when
# dispatching against a branch other than main; they'd just remove this
# line in their own copy before dispatching
jobs:
  audit:
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    runs-on: self-hosted-with-vault-access
```

The fix isn't a workflow-file check at all, since *any* check living in the
dispatched file is subject to the same bypass. Use a GitHub Environment's
deployment-branch policy instead - it's enforced server-side by GitHub
based on the *ref being dispatched*, independent of what that ref's copy of
the workflow file contains:

```yaml
jobs:
  audit:
    environment: audit-privileged  # Settings -> Environments -> Deployment
                                    # branches and tags -> "Selected branches
                                    # and tags" -> main only (org-admin action,
                                    # can't be done from the workflow file)
    runs-on: self-hosted-with-vault-access
```

This requires an actual repo-admin step (creating the environment and
setting its branch policy) that can't be expressed in the workflow file
itself - call that out explicitly as a follow-up action item rather than
letting the `environment:` line imply protection that doesn't exist yet
(an `environment:` referencing a not-yet-created environment is not an
error and adds no restriction).

`schedule`-triggered runs are unaffected either way - they always run the
default branch's copy of the workflow regardless of this setting, so this
control only actually changes `workflow_dispatch` behavior.

## curl failure handling

Two distinct gaps in a script that calls `curl` and checks the result
itself, both found on `osac-test-infra` PR #182:

**Gap 1: curl exits `0` on HTTP 4xx/5xx by default.** If the call's success
matters, use `--fail-with-body` (fails the curl invocation itself, body
still captured for logging) or manually check `-w '%{http_code}'`.

**Gap 2 (separate from Gap 1): a manually-checked status code doesn't cover
transport failures.** Even after adding `-w '%{http_code}'` to handle Gap 1,
a plain assignment is *still* subject to `set -e` if curl fails at the
transport level (DNS resolution, connection refused/reset, TLS handshake) -
that's a curl exit-code failure, not an HTTP status, so checking the status
code afterward never happens; the script dies on the assignment itself
instead:

```bash
# BAD - transport failure here trips `set -e` before the status check below
# ever runs, so a network hiccup crashes the whole script instead of
# landing in the "delete failed" branch
HTTP_CODE=$(curl -sL -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}' -X DELETE "$URL")
if [[ "${HTTP_CODE}" != "204" ]]; then ...

# GOOD - `if ! VAR=$(...)` is exempt from errexit (a plain assignment isn't);
# --connect-timeout/--max-time stop a hung connection from blocking the job
if ! HTTP_CODE=$(curl -sL -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}' -X DELETE \
  --connect-timeout 10 --max-time 30 "$URL"); then
  HTTP_CODE="curl-transport-error"
fi
# Idempotent DELETE: 404 = already gone (e.g. retry after a blip) — still OK.
if [[ "${HTTP_CODE}" != "204" && "${HTTP_CODE}" != "404" ]]; then ...
```

Apply this to *every* curl call in a script that manually checks status,
not just the one that happens to get flagged first - CodeRabbit caught this
on `scan-run-logs.sh`'s two calls in one review round, then flagged the
identical pattern in the sibling script `discover-e2e-runs.sh` (four more
calls) in the very next round once the diff included it, and the missing
`--connect-timeout`/`--max-time` half of it a *third* time after that, on
three more curl calls in `audit-workflow-logs.yml`. Three separate files,
three separate review rounds, same exact gap each time. Fix the pattern
everywhere it appears across a PR's changed files in one pass, rather than
waiting for each file to individually surface in its own review round.

**Gap 3: retries and idempotent DELETE.** Share one `fetch_with_retry`
helper (e.g. `.github/scripts/lib-github.sh`) for 429/5xx/transport blips
on **idempotent** calls (GET, DELETE, PUT with known body). Do **not**
blindly retry non-idempotent POST/PATCH unless the API accepts an
idempotency key or the caller documents a request-specific retry policy
(duplicate creates are worse than a failed notify). For DELETE, treat
**404 as success** as well as 204: a first attempt can succeed while a
retry after a transport blip sees "already gone"; counting that as purge
failure trains people to ignore real open windows.

## Fail loud on per-item batch failures

When a script loops over multiple files/items and a *later* step trusts the
*entire* result set (e.g. `actions/upload-artifact` on a "redacted" logs
directory, assuming every file in it was actually redacted), a per-item
failure must abort the whole operation - not log a warning and move on to
the next item. Found on `osac-test-infra` PR #182's `redact.py`:

```python
# BAD - looks like defensive error handling, but an unreadable file also
# couldn't be redacted, and it still ships in the "redacted" directory
# with its original secret intact
for path in redacted_dir.rglob("*"):
    try:
        text = path.read_text()
    except OSError:
        continue  # <- silently ships this file un-redacted

# GOOD - fail the whole script; let the caller's own set -e / status-file
# contract propagate this as a real failure, not a false "success"
for path in redacted_dir.rglob("*"):
    try:
        text = path.read_text()
    except OSError as exc:
        print(f"cannot read {path}, aborting: {exc}", file=sys.stderr)
        sys.exit(1)
```

The "skip and continue" instinct makes sense for a *reporting* loop (e.g.
the cross-repo audit skipping one target's listing failure and continuing
to the next) - the difference is whether skipping compromises a safety
guarantee the caller is relying on. Skipping an unscannable *target* just
means less coverage this run (and is tracked as such, per the fail-closed
status pattern below); skipping an unredactable *file* inside a batch
that's about to be uploaded as "the redacted copy" means shipping exactly
the thing the step exists to prevent.

The same fail-closed contract shows up in bash redaction pipelines that
feed a composite-action marker (e.g. `.redaction-complete` only written
when the gather script exits 0). A common false friend:

```bash
# BAD - || true is often added so an empty ARTIFACT_DIR doesn't abort,
# but it also hides a real sed failure — the script still exits 0, the
# marker gets written, and un-redacted files upload
find "${ARTIFACT_DIR}" -type f \( -name "*.log" -o -name "*.txt" \) -print0 \
  | xargs -0 sed -i -E -e 's/"password":[[:space:]]*"[^"]+"/"password": "REDACTED"/g' \
  || true

# GOOD - xargs -r (GNU) skips the command on empty input; omit || true so
# genuine sed failures still propagate. pipefail ensures a failed find is
# not masked by a successful xargs.
set -o pipefail
find "${ARTIFACT_DIR}" -type f \( -name "*.log" -o -name "*.txt" \) -print0 \
  | xargs -r -0 sed -i -E -e 's/"password":[[:space:]]*"[^"]+"/"password": "REDACTED"/g'

# GOOD - find -exec also succeeds on zero matches, fails if sed fails
# (no pipe, so no pipefail requirement)
find "${ARTIFACT_DIR}" -type f \( -name "*.log" -o -name "*.txt" \) \
  -exec sed -i -E -e 's/"password":[[:space:]]*"[^"]+"/"password": "REDACTED"/g' {} + \
  || { echo "ERROR: password redaction failed" >&2; exit 1; }
```

Pair that with nonzero exits on Python I/O errors inside the redactor
itself — a silent `except OSError: continue` has the same shape as the
`redact.py` example above.

The same distinction applies one level down, inside a single API response,
not just across targets. `discover-e2e-runs.sh` used `jq`'s `select(...)`
to drop any malformed item out of a search-results array before building
the target list - which *looks* like the same "skip and continue" as the
target-level loop, but isn't: a dropped item here has no equivalent of
`SKIPPED_TARGETS` counting it, so `DISCOVERY_FAILED` stays `false` and the
result is indistinguishable from "every item was valid." If you don't have
a per-item tracking counter, treat one malformed item as invalidating the
*whole* response instead - `jq -e 'all(.items[]?; <shape check>)'` before
extracting anything, not `select(...)` while extracting:

```bash
# BAD - one malformed item just vanishes, nothing downstream ever learns
# an item was dropped
jq -r '.items[]? | select(.field != null) | ...' "$RESP" | ...

# GOOD - one malformed item invalidates the whole response
if ! jq -e 'all(.items[]?; (.field | type) == "string")' "$RESP" >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  DISCOVERY_FAILED=true
else
  jq -r '.items[]? | ...' "$RESP" | ...
fi
```

## Detection vs. remediation status

Finding a problem and successfully acting on it are two operations that can
fail independently - don't fold them into one status flag. Found on
`osac-test-infra` PR #182's `scan-run-logs.sh`: gitleaks finding leaked
secrets (`LEAKS_FOUND=true`) and then successfully deleting the raw logs
that contained them (`PURGE_OK`) are separate outcomes; a delete-API call
can fail for reasons that have nothing to do with whether anything was
found (permissions, a transient 5xx, a transport error). Before this was
split out, a failed delete still got reported - in both the job summary and
the audit's tracking-issue body - as "the raw logs have been deleted",
which is simply false when the delete call failed.

Give remediation its own flag, meaningful only when detection actually
found something (a clean scan has nothing to remediate, so the flag is
vacuously `true` in that case - see the `SCAN_OK`/`LEAKS_FOUND`/`PURGE_OK`
three-way split in `scan-run-logs.sh` for a worked example), and make every
downstream summary/notification conditional on it rather than assuming the
remediation step that ran right after detection must have succeeded.

The same principle showed up again one review round later, in a different
shape: `audit-workflow-logs.yml`'s job summary and tracking-issue body both
unconditionally linked to an `audit-redacted-logs-*` artifact once findings
existed, regardless of whether the `actions/upload-artifact` step that was
supposed to produce it had actually succeeded. "Detection" (finding leaked
credentials) and "the artifact upload that's supposed to preserve evidence
of them" are just as independent as "detection" and "purge" were - give the
upload step an `id`, check `steps.<id>.outcome`, and only promise the
artifact link when it's actually there.

## Don't re-echo redacted diagnostics

Redacting files before `actions/upload-artifact` is necessary but not
sufficient if a later step reprints those files (or a `grep -C` around
them) into the job console. Example: plaintext credential JSON in
application logs was already redacted in the artifact, but the same
passwords also appeared **base64-encoded inside SQL DEBUG parameters**.
A "failure summary" step that grepped `error|panic|fatal` with `-C3`
and `echo`'d the matches into the job log re-introduced those blobs
into the *workflow run logs* - which is what a downstream log scanner
sees - so every green run still tripped "Credential(s) detected"
on Slack.

Two independent mistakes, both required:

1. **Encoding gap.** Plaintext JSON redaction never sees a base64 payload.
   JWT-shaped redaction (`eyJ.a.b`) misses single-segment base64 JSON.
   Substring-matching the base64 of the key name
   (`ZXhhbXBsZV9zZWNyZXRfa2V5` for `example_secret_key`) is
   alignment-fragile - embedding the key at an arbitrary byte offset does
   not preserve a stable base64 substring. Decode each quoted candidate
   (standard and URL-safe) and look for the key in the plaintext; when
   found, replace the original encoded candidate in the output with a
   redaction marker (the encoded form is just as sensitive as the
   plaintext). Use strict decode (`validate=True`, and `altchars=b"-_"`
   / equivalent for URL-safe). Normalize `=` padding before decode —
   unpadded URL-safe tokens otherwise fail under `validate=True` and
   redaction can miss them. Cover both padded and unpadded encoded-secret
   fixtures in tests. Permissive `validate=False` can silently strip
   `-`/`_` from URL-safe input and miss the needle entirely.
2. **Re-echo gap.** Even a perfect artifact redaction is undone if the
   job log reprints the pre-fix content (or a redaction miss) via
   `grep -C` / `cat` / `$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY`. Keep the full
   **redacted/sanitized** dump in the artifact; never upload raw
   secret-bearing content to artifacts, summaries, or logs. Print only
   a count/pointer to the console.

Related: quoted password/token sed classes that only allow
`[A-Za-z0-9+/=]` miss real passwords with punctuation (`@`, `%`, `#`) -
prefer JSON parsing for structured values; if using regex, `[^"]+` is a
starting point for double-quoted JSON but misses escaped quotes (`\"`).
Adapt the approach for other contexts (single-quoted, URL-embedded).

Separately, when a post-run scanner *does* find credentials in an
otherwise-green run, don't post the notify as `status: failure` for the
upstream e2e workflow name - that reads as "e2e FAILED" to anyone
blessing PRs. Use `warning` (or similar) when detection and remediation
both succeeded; keep `failure` for scan/purge hard failures. Same
axis-splitting idea as [detection vs. remediation](#detection-vs-remediation-status).

## Shared scripts

Copy-pasting the same bash logic into multiple `run:` blocks - especially
across separate jobs, which can't share in-memory state anyway - means every
future fix has to be applied everywhere, and it's easy to miss one:

```yaml
# BAD - same verification logic duplicated in 4+ steps across 2+ jobs
- run: |
    read -r current_type current_sha <<< "$(gh api ...)"
    if [[ "$current_type" == "tag" ]]; then ...

# GOOD - one script, invoked wherever needed
- run: .github/scripts/verify-tag-matches-sha.sh
```

Put it in `.github/scripts/`, `chmod +x` it, and have it read inputs from
already-exported `env:` vars rather than positional args. See
[scripts/verify-tag-matches-sha.sh](scripts/verify-tag-matches-sha.sh) for a
working example.

Don't let two jobs independently *recompute* the same result either (not
just similar logic - the literal same output) - a new tag could land between
two separate invocations, silently making a later step act on a different
value than what an earlier step already validated. Pass it forward instead:
- **Small scalar** (a version string, a SHA) -> job `outputs`.
- **File-based/structured data** -> `upload-artifact` from the producer,
  `download-artifact` in the consumer, instead of re-running the generator.

## Live-testing gotchas

Static checks (`actionlint`, `bash -n`) can't validate a `workflow_run`
trigger's actual runtime behavior. When testing on a personal fork:

- **Concurrency-group collisions**: if the test tag points at the same
  commit as a `push`-to-`main` build, and both workflows share a
  concurrency group keyed by the commit SHA, GitHub queues one behind the
  other - it looks stuck but isn't. On a `workflow_run` trigger, key the
  group off `github.event.workflow_run.head_sha`, not plain `github.sha` -
  the latter resolves to the default branch's latest commit on this event
  type, not the commit that triggered the run, so it silently fails to
  collide with the build it's supposed to be paired with.
- **GHCR "Manage Actions access" chicken-and-egg**: pushing a *new* OCI
  package under a nested path that doesn't match the repo name (e.g.
  `charts/<name>` vs. repo `<name>`) 403s on the very first push, even with
  a correctly-scoped `GITHUB_TOKEN` - the auto-link-package-to-repo behavior
  only reliably triggers when the package name matches the repo name. Fix:
  seed the package once via a personal-access-token push from outside
  Actions, then manually add the repo under the package's "Manage Actions
  access" with Write role (no API exists for this step, UI only).
- **A public fork's Actions are disabled by default** until the owner
  clicks through the one-time "I understand my workflows, go ahead and
  enable them" banner - `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/actions/runs --jq
  .total_count` returning `0` even after a direct push is the tell. This is
  scenario-specific, though: `schedule:`-triggered workflows stay disabled
  on a public fork even after that banner is clicked (no equivalent
  one-time unlock exists for cron), and pull-request runs *from* a fork are
  gated by a separate "approve and run" requirement on top of it. Private
  forks aren't affected by any of this the same way - don't apply this note
  there unchanged.
- **AI review bots can auto-pause** after enough rapid-fire commits on one
  PR ("branch under active development") and silently stop posting
  anything - neither approve nor request-changes. Check for this before
  assuming a stalled review means everything already passed; most bots
  (e.g. CodeRabbit via `@coderabbitai review`) need to be manually
  re-triggered with a PR comment to review the pending commits.

## Re-triggering a failed check

Don't assume every red check is a Prow `/retest` - check which system actually
owns the run first, by looking at the failed check's "Details" link URL:

- **Native GitHub Actions run** (URL is `github.com/<owner>/<repo>/actions/runs/...`):
  re-run via `gh run rerun <run-id> --repo <owner>/<repo> --failed` (CLI), or
  the "Re-run failed jobs" button on the Actions run page (UI). `--failed`
  only re-runs the failed job(s), not the whole matrix - faster than a full
  re-run, and preserves logs from the jobs that already passed.
- **Prow-orchestrated check** (URL is `prow.ci.openshift.org/...`, common for
  e2e/integration suites gated by `tide`): comment `/retest` on the PR
  instead - `gh run rerun` doesn't apply since GitHub Actions never owned
  the run.

## Self-check / test script hygiene

Found via review of this skill's own
[scripts/self-check.sh](scripts/self-check.sh) - the same scrutiny applies
to any test/verification script, not just the workflows it exercises:

- **Don't discard a subprocess's output on failure just because you only
  check its exit code.** `cmd &>/dev/null; then pass; else fail "should
  have succeeded"; fi` gives a real regression and a transient network
  hiccup an identical, contentless failure message. Capture combined
  output into a variable and include it in the failure message instead:
  `out="$(cmd 2>&1)" && pass || fail "should have succeeded: $out"`.
- **If a test exercises a real external resource** (a specific repo, tag,
  or endpoint), make it overridable via env vars with the current value as
  the default (`REPO="${SELF_CHECK_REPO:-osac-project/osac-operator}"`)
  rather than hardcoding it, and provide an explicit skip switch (e.g.
  `SELF_CHECK_SKIP_LIVE=1`) for offline/sandboxed runs. The test's own
  reliability shouldn't be permanently coupled to one third party's tag
  never disappearing or a network call always succeeding.
- **If any step degrades to "skip" rather than "fail" when an optional
  tool is missing, say so wherever the script's guarantee is described.**
  An all-green run with `actionlint`/`gh`/etc. absent is a materially
  weaker guarantee than one with everything present - don't let the
  wording imply otherwise.

## Niche bash pitfalls

- **`"${arr[*]}"` only honors the first character of a multi-character
  `IFS`.** `IFS=", "; echo "${arr[*]}"` joins with `,` only, silently
  dropping the space. Join explicitly instead:

  ```bash
  joined=$(printf ', %s' "${arr[@]}"); joined="${joined#, }"
  ```

- **Shallow submodule clones break `git describe --tags` inside them.**
  `actions/checkout` clones submodules at `--depth=1` even when the
  superproject uses `fetch-depth: 0` - that setting doesn't propagate to
  submodules. `git describe --tags` fails outright with no ancestor history;
  an `|| echo "<fallback>"` will silently swallow this every time in CI
  while working fine locally (where a full clone already exists). Unshallow
  first if needed: `git -C "$path" fetch --unshallow --tags --quiet`
  (guard with `git rev-parse --is-shallow-repository` since `--unshallow`
  errors on an already-complete repo).
- **`git describe --tags --abbrev=0` picks whichever tag is nearest HEAD**,
  including unrelated tag namespaces (e.g. a Go submodule's `api/vX.Y.Z`
  alongside chart releases' plain `vX.Y.Z`). Always pass `--match` with the
  exact expected pattern - and re-validate the result with a real regex
  afterward, since `--match` is glob (fnmatch), not regex, and can't express
  "digits only, then nothing else".
- **Re-running a failed workflow run only increments `GITHUB_RUN_ATTEMPT`**,
  not `GITHUB_RUN_ID`/`GITHUB_RUN_NUMBER`. A run-scoped identifier built from
  only the latter two will collide on "Re-run failed jobs" against the same
  base commit - include `GITHUB_RUN_ATTEMPT` too if the identifier needs to
  be unique per attempt, not just per run.
- **`git add -A -- pathA pathB` fails atomically (stages nothing) if *any*
  one pathspec doesn't exist in that repo** - e.g. reusing the same commit
  command across sibling repos where only some have a `build-image.yaml`.
  Stage each file individually (`git add -- pathA; git add -- pathB`) or
  filter to paths that actually exist first, rather than one combined
  command copy-pasted across repos with differing layouts.
- **A command's exit status inside process substitution (`done < <(cmd)`)
  is invisible to the surrounding shell, even under `set -e`.** If `cmd`
  fails partway through emitting output (e.g. `jq` hits a malformed item
  mid-stream), whatever it already flushed still reaches the loop as if
  nothing went wrong - the failure never trips `errexit` and the loop
  variable driving your success/failure tracking (e.g. `DISCOVERY_FAILED`)
  never finds out. Redirect to a file with its own explicitly-checked exit
  status first, then loop over the file, instead of piping straight into
  the loop:

  ```bash
  # BAD - a jq failure partway through leaves TARGETS silently partial,
  # with nothing here to notice
  while IFS= read -r TARGET; do
    TARGETS+=("${TARGET}")
  done < <(jq -r '.items[]? | ...' "${RESP}" | sort -u)

  # GOOD
  if ! jq -r '.items[]? | ...' "${RESP}" | sort -u > "${TARGETS_FILE}"; then
    DISCOVERY_FAILED=true
  else
    while IFS= read -r TARGET; do
      TARGETS+=("${TARGET}")
    done < "${TARGETS_FILE}"
  fi
  ```

- **`if ! some_function; then` suspends `set -e` for the function's
  *entire* body, not just its final exit status** - the inverse problem
  from the process-substitution one above, and useful for exactly the case
  it causes trouble in: a multi-step per-item loop body (call a script,
  `cp` a result, `jq`-append a summary) where one step's failure shouldn't
  abort the whole loop, but you still want each step's own failure caught
  and handled rather than silently ignored. Move the risky calls into a
  function, explicitly check each one's exit status *inside* the function
  (they won't trip `errexit` on their own once the function itself is
  invoked from an `if !`/`&&`/`||` context), and set/return whatever the
  caller needs to track:

  ```bash
  # Called as `if ! process_one_run ...; then` - every command below runs
  # to completion regardless of an earlier one failing, since -e is
  # suspended for the whole function in that calling context. Counters
  # referenced here (not `local`) update the loop's own copies.
  process_one_run() {
    if ! scan-run-logs.sh "$1"; then SKIPPED_SCANS=$((SKIPPED_SCANS+1)); return 0; fi
    if ! cp -r "$src" "$dst"; then PROCESSING_FAILURES=$((PROCESSING_FAILURES+1)); return 0; fi
    ...
  }
  for item in "${ITEMS[@]}"; do
    process_one_run "${item}"  # a plain call here would NOT suspend -e
  done
  ```

  Found on `osac-test-infra` PR #182's `audit-workflow-logs.yml`: the
  per-run audit loop called `scan-run-logs.sh`, then `cp`, then `jq`, as
  plain commands - a failure on any of them for run N aborted the whole
  step, which also meant losing the `flagged-count` output (and therefore
  the tracking-issue report) for every leak already found on runs 1..N-1,
  not just failing to process run N itself.

  A follow-up round on the same file found the inverse mistake: the calls
  *inside* `process_one_run` were correctly guarded, but the loop's own
  call to `process_one_run` itself had regressed to a bare statement (no
  `if !`). A latent bug in the function's last statement - `[[ cond ]] &&
  cmd` as the final line, which returns `1` whenever `cond` is false, even
  though nothing actually failed - then had nothing stopping it from
  aborting the whole loop on the very next *successful* run. Fixing the
  function's own return value (an explicit trailing `return 0`) resolves
  that specific bug, but isn't a substitute for guarding the call site too
  - do both: guard every call to a function like this at its call site
  *and* make sure the function itself can't return non-zero on a path that
  isn't an actual failure. Either one alone is one future edit away from
  reintroducing this same class of bug.
- **`grep -o` combined with `-v` in the same invocation silently produces no
  output at all**, not an error and not the "non-matching lines, matched
  portion only" result the flag names would suggest:

  ```bash
  $ printf 'aaaa\nbbbb\n' | grep -ovE 'bbbb$'
  # (nothing - not "aaaa", not an error, exit 0)
  ```

  A staleness check built on this (e.g. "does this file have any pin that
  *doesn't* already equal the target SHA") silently evaluates to "nothing
  stale" on every input, since `-v`'s line-selection and `-o`'s
  matched-portion-only output don't compose the way each flag would suggest
  alone - GNU grep just returns empty rather than raising an error. Verify
  any `grep -o ... | grep -o/-v ...` two-stage pipeline against a small
  fixture with a known expected result before trusting it, and prefer an
  explicit set-difference instead of relying on the combination working:
  `comm -23 <(all_values | sort -u) <(printf '%s\n' "$target" | sort -u)`.

## Sparse-checkout cone mode blocks single-file checkouts

`actions/checkout`'s `sparse-checkout` input defaults to cone mode, which
only accepts directory-level patterns. A single-file path like
`.github/scripts/check-floating-tags.sh` silently checks out nothing
useful in cone mode — you get the directory structure but not the file.
Disable cone mode explicitly:

```yaml
- uses: actions/checkout@<sha>  # v7
  with:
    sparse-checkout: .github/scripts/check-floating-tags.sh
    sparse-checkout-cone-mode: false   # required for file-level patterns
    path: trusted
```

This showed up when checking out a trusted base-branch script alongside
the full PR checkout — the script simply didn't appear in the `trusted/`
directory until cone mode was disabled.

## PR-controlled enforcement scripts

A `pull_request`-triggered workflow that checks out the PR's code and runs a
script from that checkout is **self-enforcing, not tamper-proof**: a
contributor can modify the script in the same PR to always return success.
Example: an enforcement script such as `check-floating-tags.sh` that runs
from the PR checkout can be neutered in that same PR.

These levels are for **workflow authors / maintainers** choosing how to
protect an enforcement check — not something a PR creator picks at submit
time. Choose by whether the repo trusts all contributors, or must resist
adversarial PRs:

1. **Trusted contributors (internal repos):** Accept the risk. The script
   and workflow paths should be covered by CODEOWNERS so changes require
   maintainer approval. Note: CODEOWNERS alone only *requests* review —
   you must also enable branch protection with "Require review from Code
   Owners" to make approval mandatory. This protects the enforcement
   script/workflow paths; it does not mean ordinary CI/E2E waits for
   CODEOWNERS approval on human-authored PRs (gating bot-authored PRs
   such as `osac-dev-bot` is a separate policy choice). Document accepted
   risk in the PR description when you rely on this level.

2. **Base-branch checkout (script integrity only):** Check out the script
   from the base branch instead of the PR head so the PR can't modify the
   *script body*. This is not sufficient alone: on a same-repo
   `pull_request`, the workflow file can still come from the PR head, so a
   contributor can remove the step, change its args, or skip the call.
   When the base branch lacks the trusted script, fail closed — do not
   fall back to the PR copy.

   ```yaml
   - uses: actions/checkout@<sha>  # v7
     with:
       ref: ${{ github.event.pull_request.base.sha }}
       persist-credentials: false
       path: trusted
   - uses: actions/checkout@<sha>  # v7
     with:
       persist-credentials: false
       path: pr
   - run: bash "$GITHUB_WORKSPACE/trusted/.github/scripts/check-floating-tags.sh"
     working-directory: pr
   ```

   Trade-off: more complex checkout, and the script version can trail the
   PR if the PR legitimately updates both the script and the values. Pair
   with level 3 when the repo must resist adversarial PRs.

3. **Protected reusable workflow + required check:** Move the enforcement
   into a reusable workflow in a protected repo (e.g. `osac-test-infra`)
   and make that check a required status check on the target branch. A bare
   required check is not enough if a PR-controlled workflow can keep the
   same check name and always succeed — the workflow that produces the
   check must itself be trusted (reusable from a protected repo, or
   otherwise outside PR control). The calling repo cannot alter the
   reusable workflow's code, and omitting the call fails the merge gate.
   Trade-off: cross-repo dependency and pin maintenance.

## workflow_run gate pattern

The single highest-value pattern from the OSAC-2185 cycle: gating a
chart/release publish on a sibling image-build workflow's success, instead
of both triggering independently off the same tag push (which lets a chart
"publish" even when the matching image never got built).

**Upstream contract:** the image-build workflow must trigger only on tag
pushes (`on: push: tags: ['v*']`), not on branches. The guard below treats
`workflow_run.head_branch` as a tag name; a *branch* literally named
`v1.2.3` would also match the semver regex — don't rely on the regex alone
if the upstream workflow can run on branch pushes. After checkout, prefer
confirming `refs/tags/${TAG}` exists (the shared
`verify-tag-matches-sha.sh` path) before publishing.

```yaml
name: Publish something

on:
  workflow_run:
    workflows: ["Build container image"]  # must match the *name:* field, not the filename
    # Assumes that workflow is tag-push-only (see Upstream contract above).

Copy `scripts/verify-tag-matches-sha.sh` from this skill into the target
repo's `.github/scripts/` and `chmod +x` it - don't reimplement the
dereferencing/failure-masking logic inline.

**This checkout is the repo's own tagged source**, not untrusted PR code, so
the classic `workflow_run` privilege-escalation risk doesn't directly apply.
That still assumes only authorized release actors can create `v*` tags —
restrict tag creation (and block force-moves) per
[tag-immutability](#tag-immutability); do not treat "tagged on the default
remote" as proof of a trusted releaser.
If you adapt this pattern for a workflow triggered by untrusted contributions
(e.g. `pull_request` from forks), never check out or execute contributor code
in the privileged `publish` job. See
[workflow_run privilege escalation](#workflow_run-privilege-escalation).

Tag create-restriction + immutability aren't optional here — without them
the SHA re-checks above imply a stronger guarantee than they provide. See
[tag-immutability](#tag-immutability).

## always() for notify and evidence

A bare `if: <condition>` (no `success()` / `failure()` / `always()`)
implicitly ANDs with `success()`, so a hard failure in an *earlier* step -
exactly the case most worth alerting on - silently skips the notification
or evidence upload meant to catch it. Found repeatedly on OSAC-1684 scan /
audit workflows.

```yaml
# BAD - skipped if the "scan" step hard-fails (not just sets leaks-found)
- if: steps.scan.outputs.leaks-found == 'true'
  run: notify-slack ...

# GOOD - notify
- if: >
    always() &&
    (steps.scan.outcome == 'failure' || steps.scan.outputs.leaks-found == 'true')
  run: notify-slack ...

# GOOD - redacted evidence upload: confirmed leak *or* hard scan fail
# (leaks-found may be unset if the composite died before publishing outputs)
- if: >
    always() &&
    (steps.scan.outcome == 'failure' || steps.scan.outputs.leaks-found == 'true')
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@<sha>
```

Only promise the artifact link in summaries when
`steps.upload.outcome == 'success'` (see
[detection vs remediation](#detection-vs-remediation-status)).

Upload may still no-op / error when `redacted/` is empty after a hard fail
before any redact completed — that is fine; the point is not to skip the
step entirely via the implicit `success()` AND.

## zizmor permission comments

`zizmor`'s `undocumented-permissions` rule wants the rationale on the
**permission line itself**, matching sibling scopes. A comment *above* the
line does not count:

```yaml
# BAD - zizmor still warns on pull-requests
# Comment on the PR when leaks are found.
pull-requests: write

# GOOD
contents: read  # checkout only, no push
actions: write  # fetch/delete completed run's logs
pull-requests: write  # comment leak findings on the triggering PR
```

## composite action path resolution

A composite action invoked cross-repo via
`uses: org/repo/.github/actions/foo@<sha>` unpacks under `GITHUB_ACTION_PATH`.
The *caller's* `$GITHUB_WORKSPACE` is a different checkout and often does
**not** contain the action's sibling scripts or jq modules.

```bash
# BAD - breaks mirrors / cross-repo uses:
jq -L "${GITHUB_WORKSPACE}/.github/scripts" 'include "md-cell"; ...'

# GOOD - same pattern as invoking the scanner script:
SCRIPTS_DIR="${GITHUB_ACTION_PATH}/../../scripts"
"${GITHUB_ACTION_PATH}/../../scripts/scan-run-logs.sh" ...
jq -L "${SCRIPTS_DIR}" 'include "md-cell"; ...'
```

Same-repo workflows that already checked out the defining repo may use
`$GITHUB_WORKSPACE/.github/scripts`; composites that can be reused
cross-repo must not.

## markdown cell sanitization

Escaping only `|` is not enough for Markdown tables or PR comments built
from gitleaks / artifact-controlled `RuleID` / `File` values. Also:

1. Strip `\r` / `\n` (row-break / inject).
2. HTML-escape `&`, `<`, `>`.
3. Escape `|` for table cells.
4. Neutralize Markdown link/image syntax in attacker-controlled fields
   (e.g. strip or escape `[`, `]`, `(`, `)`, `!`) so a crafted `File` path
   cannot render as a clickable link or image in the comment/summary.
   Prefer rendering the cell as a safely escaped code span when the
   surrounding Markdown allows it.

Prefer **one** shared jq module (e.g. `.github/scripts/md-cell.jq` with
`def cell: ...`) loaded via `jq -L <dir> 'include "md-cell"; ...'`, and a
separate producer sanitizer for `findings.json` (CR/LF only, drop secrets).
Don't re-implement the filter in the job summary, PR comment, and trap.

## best-effort side effects

After scan/purge has already succeeded, side effects like `gh pr comment`
must not fail the job under `set -e`. Treat API / closed-PR races as
warnings; keep Slack/summary as the durable signal. Don't claim "purged" in
the failure warning when `PURGE_OK` may be false.

`workflow_run.pull_requests` is often empty (especially fork PRs). Resolve
open PRs for `head_sha` carefully — require exactly one open match (paginate
`commits/.../pulls`); skip when zero or ambiguous.

## atomic status writes

Write `status.env` / `findings.json` via `mktemp` in the same directory,
then `mv` only after success. A failed `jq` (or EXIT-trap sanitizer) must
not truncate/replace a previously valid file the trap or caller still needs.

## scan logs and artifacts

Credential scanners that only fetch `actions/runs/<id>/logs` miss secrets
dumped into uploaded artifacts (e.g. AAP job stdout). List/download/scan
artifacts too; on hit, DELETE the tainted artifact as well as logs.

Never copy raw trees straight into the evidence upload directory. **Stage
outside the upload root** (e.g. `${OUTPUT_DIR}/.redact-staging-*`), run
redaction there, and only `mv` successfully redacted trees into
`redacted/` (the path `actions/upload-artifact` publishes). A failed or
aborted redact must leave nothing secret-bearing under the upload root.
